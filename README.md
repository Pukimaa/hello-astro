# `HelloAstro` Component

This is a component that returns a random greeting...nothing more.

### ‚ùå Something's missing or wrong?
Please create a PR and follow these rules:
- The translation should be just "Hello"
- It should be the informal hello
- Just create a new Array Value in the `greetings.js` like the following:
    - `"Hello in Language X", // Language X Name`
